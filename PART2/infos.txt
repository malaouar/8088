enhanced Minimal 8088 based Board.

 Only 8 ICs: 8088 + 8284, PPI (8255), 74LS139, two 74LS373, RAM and EEROM.
 I've a 512k byte SRAM but u can use any available chip, higher capcity = better.

The simplified schematic is given in photo "schem1.jpg". 
more details about address decoding in "decoder.jpg".

- Address lines A0-A8 and A6-A19 are demultiplexed using two 74LS373 latchs.
- ADDRESS and DATA buses are not buffered.
- We use IO/M and A19 lines with the 74LS139 to select the ROM, RAM or the PPI (by pulling the CE pin low):
  *if IO/M is LOW the ROM  or RAM is selected.
  A19 HIGH ==> ROM selected.
  A19 LOW  ==> RAM selected.
  *if IO/M is HIGH the PPI is selected (whatever the state of A19 is).

- The circuit must be powered by a regulated 5V supply @ 0.5A or more.

SOFTWARE:

PROGRAM1- SD.asm: a program to copy one sector to another.
  The SD is accessed in SPI mode using a software bit-bang SPI master.
  
  SD CARD     PORTC 
    MISO       C0 
    CLK        C4    via 2.2k resitor
    CS         C5    via 4.7k resitor
    MOSI       C7    via 4.7k resitor

The SD card is powered with a 3.3V regulator.

Note: We use the PC and an SD card reader/writer to write data to a sector on the SD.


PROGRAM2- N3410.asm: a program to innitialize the LCD and draw text.
  The LCD is commanded in SPI mode using a software bit-bang SPI master.
  
	N3410 LCD     PORTC 
       DC          C1
	   CE          C3
       CLK         C4    via 2.2k resitor
       RST         C5    via 4.7k resitor
       DATA        C7    via 4.7k resitor
	
The LCD is powered with a 3.3V regulator.
