HARDWARE:

1- PS2 keyboard:
connect the adaptor to the board as in "schem.jpg".
You may need pull-up resistors on CLK and DATA lines.
When using interrupt, The CLK signal is used to fire the NMI interrupt through a 1ms monostable as shown in "NMI.jpg".

2- VGA:
 An ATMEGA8 is used to generate VGA signals in 640x480 mode and display text with auto scroll up. 
 This work is inspired by many projects in the web:

SOFTWARE:

PROGRAM1- KB1.asm: a program to read scan code of a pressed key and display it on a 7 segment display.
PROGRAM2- KB2.asm: same as above but it uses the NMI interrupt.


A simple OS:
 - BIOS: functions to display text on VGA, read keyboard, access SD card ....
 - FAT16 bootloader
 - Kernel (in binary format)
 - Some apps.
