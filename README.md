# 8088
Intel 8088 based Single Board Computer (SBC).
The goal of this repo is to share my emperiments with the 8088 microprocessor.
I've built a simple board using the 8088 at 4.77MHz and:
- a 8255 PPI.
- 8K ROM.
- 512K SRAM.
I've interfaced to this board: LEDs, 2x16 LCD, SD card, Nokia 3410 LCD, PS2 keyboard .....
